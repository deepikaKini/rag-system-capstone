2,"Mixed Mode Arithmetic and Casting","
Mixed Mode Arithmetic and Casting:
- converted to the heaviest type (byte → char → short → int → l → f → d).
- Example: 2 + 3.3 is interpreted as 2.0 + 3.3.
- You can change the type using casting (place the target type in parentheses).
- Example: 
  - aInt = 2 + (int) 3.3
  - aInt = ?? (2 + 3.3)
  - aDouble = 2 + 3.3

Java Operators Example:
- Example program dealing with operators:
  - Outputs:
    1. 'b'
    2. 2
    3. 2a (my assumption)
    4. 20
    5. b0
    6. 1 (int division)
    7. 2 (remainder)
    8. 1 (casting double to int)
    9. 1.04167 (double division)
    10. 1.04167 (double division with 5.0)
